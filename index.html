  <h1>AdShakti â€“ Child Safety and CSAE Prevention Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> June 3, 2025</p>

  <p>At AdShakti, we are committed to maintaining a safe and secure platform for all users. We have zero tolerance for any form of child sexual abuse and exploitation (CSAE). This policy outlines our preventative measures, detection mechanisms, and reporting procedures to protect children and support the global fight against CSAE.</p>

  <h2>1. Prohibited Content</h2>
  <p>We strictly prohibit the following on our platform:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Any media, communication, or behavior involving CSAE, including images, videos, text, or links.</li>
    <li>Solicitation of minors or promotion of sexual content involving children.</li>
    <li>Impersonation or identity fraud involving minors.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. Detection & Monitoring</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We utilize automated and manual moderation techniques to detect and block abusive content before it is published.</li>
    <li>Our internal moderation team regularly reviews reported content, user behavior, and flagged activity.</li>
    <li>We cooperate with relevant authorities and comply with takedown and legal data requests.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. User Reporting</h2>
  <p>Users can report any inappropriate or suspicious content directly within the app using the built-in report feature. Every report is reviewed promptly and appropriate action is taken, including removal, suspension, or escalation to law enforcement.</p>

  <h2>4. Legal Compliance & Reporting</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>AdShakti fully complies with applicable child safety laws and industry standards globally.</li>
    <li>All CSAE-related content or user activity is immediately reported to regional and national authorities, including but not limited to law enforcement and child protection agencies.</li>
  </ul>
